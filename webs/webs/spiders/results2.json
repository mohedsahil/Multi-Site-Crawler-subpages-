By accessing or otherwise interacting with our servers, services, websites, or any associated content/postings (together, \"CL\"), you agree to these Terms of Use (\"TOU\") (last updated December 29, 2017). You acknowledge and agree CL is a private site owned and operated by craigslist, Inc. If you are accessing or using CL on behalf of a business, that business agrees to the TOU. If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not authorized to use CL. We may modify the TOU at any time in our sole discretion. You are responsible for periodically checking for changes and are bound by them if you continue to use CL. Our privacy policy ( ), prohibited list ( ), and all other policies, site rules, and agreements referenced below or on CL, are fully incorporated into this TOU, and you agree to them as well. If you agree to the TOU and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to use CL and be bound by the TOU, or (2) use CL on behalf of a business, thereby binding that business to the TOU, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use CL in compliance with the TOU; unlicensed use is unauthorized. You agree not to display, \"frame,\" make derivative works, distribute, license, or sell, content from CL, excluding postings you create. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post. Unless licensed by us in a written agreement, you agree not to use or provide software (except general purpose web browsers and email clients) or services that interact or interoperate with CL, e.g. for downloading, uploading, creating/accessing/using an account, posting, flagging, emailing, searching, or mobile use. You agree not to copy/collect CL content via robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or any automated or manual equivalent (e.g., by hand). Misleading, unsolicited, and/or unlawful postings/communications/accounts are prohibited, as is buying or selling accounts. You agree not to post content that is prohibited by any of CL's policies or rules referenced above (\"Prohibited Content\"). You agree not to abuse CL's flagging or reporting processes. You agree not to collect CL user information or interfere with CL. You agree we may moderate CL access/use in our sole discretion, e.g., by blocking, filtering, re-categorizing, re-ranking, deleting, delaying, holding, omitting, verifying, or terminating your access/license/account. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not. You further agree that if you violate the USE section, or you encourage, support, benefit from, or induce others to do so, you will be jointly and severally liable to us for liquidated damages as follows for: (A) collecting/harvesting CL users' information, including personal or identifying information - $1 per violation; (B) publishing/misusing personal or identifying information of a third party in connection with your use of CL without that party's express written consent - $1,000 per violation; (C) misrepresenting your identity or affiliation to anyone in connection with your use of CL - $1,000 per violation; (D) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content - $4 per violation; (E) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content in any paid section of CL - the price per post applicable to that section of CL; (F) sending an unauthorized/unsolicited email to an email address obtained from CL - $25 per violation; (G) using CL user information to make/send an unauthorized/unsolicited text message, call, or communication to a CL user - $500 per text/call/communication; (H) creating a misleading or unlawful CL account or buying/selling a CL account - $4 per violation; (I) abusing or attempting to abuse CL's flagging or reporting processes - $1 per violation; (J) distributing any software to facilitate violations of the USE Section - $1,000 per violation; (K) aggregating, displaying, copying, duplicating, reproducing, distributing, or exploiting CL content for any purpose without our express written consent - $3,000 for each day you engage in such violations; (L) requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000 pages of CL in any 24-hour period - $0.25 per page during the 24 hour period after the first 1,000 pages; (M) bypassing or attempting to bypass our moderation efforts - $4 per violation. You agree that these amounts are (1) a reasonable estimate of our damages (as actual damages are often difficult to calculate), (2) not a penalty, and (3) not otherwise limiting on our ability to recover under any legal theory or claim, including statutory damages and other equitable relief (e.g., for spam, we can elect between the above liquidated damages or statutory damages under the anti-spam statute). You further agree that repeated violations of the USE section will irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages. You authorize us to charge your account for CL fees in paid areas ( ). Any tax is additional. Fees are non-refundable, even for posts we remove, delay, omit, re-categorize, re-rank, or otherwise moderate. We may refuse any posting. To the full extent permitted by law, craigslist, Inc., and its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, affiliates, and successors in interest (\"CL Entities\") (1) make no promises, warranties, or representations as to CL, including its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability; (2) provide CL on an \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\" basis and any risk of using CL is assumed by you; (3) disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including as to accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement; and (4) disclaim any liability or responsibility for acts, omissions, or conduct of you or any party in connection with CL. CL Entities are NOT liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or other losses, including lost profits, revenues, data, goodwill, etc., arising from or related to CL, and in no event shall such liability exceed $100 or the amount you paid us in the year preceding such loss. Some jurisdictions restrict or alter these disclaimers and limits, so some may not apply to you. Any claim, cause of action, demand, or dispute arising from or related to CL (\"Claims\") will be governed by the internal laws of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions, except to the extent governed by US federal law. Any Claims will be exclusively resolved by courts in San Francisco, CA (except we may seek preliminary or injunctive relief anywhere). You agree to (1) submit to the personal jurisdiction of courts in San Francisco, CA; (2) indemnify and hold CL Entities harmless from any Claims, losses, liability, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) that arise from a third party and relate to your use of CL; and (3) be liable and responsible for any Claims we may have against your officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, or any other party, directly or indirectly, paid, directed or controlled by you, or acting for your benefit. CRAIGSLIST, \"CL\" and the peace symbol logo are registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with multiple trademark offices around the world. Users complying with prior written licenses may access CL thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us and you, and our actions or silence toward you or anyone else does not waive, modify, or limit the TOU or our ability to enforce it. The USE, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, and CLAIMS & INDEMNITY sections survive termination of the TOU, and you will remain bound by those sections. If a TOU term is unenforceable, it shall be limited to the least extent possible and supplemented with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of the parties.

Bạn thừa nhận và đồng ý rằng CL là một trang web tư nhân sở hữu và vận hành bởi craigslist, Inc. Nếu bạn đang đại diện cho một doanh nghiệp truy cập hoặc sử dụng CL, doanh nghiệp đó đồng ý với TOU. Nếu bạn không đồng ý với TOU, bạn không được phép sử dụng CL. Chúng tôi có thể sửa đổi TOU bất cứ lúc nào theo ý của chúng tôi. Bạn có trách nhiệm kiểm tra định kỳ những thay đổi và bị ràng buộc bởi chúng nếu bạn tiếp tục sử dụng CL. Chính sách về quyền riêng tư của chúng tôi ( ), danh sách cấm đoán ( ), và tất cả các chính sách, quy định của trang web và các thỏa thuận khác được đề cập dưới đây hoặc trên CL, được tích hợp hoàn toàn vào TOU này, và bạn cũng đồng ý với chúng. Nếu bạn đồng ý với TOU và (1) đủ tuổi và đủ khả năng sử dụng CL và bị ràng buộc bởi TOU, hoặc (2) đại diện cho một doanh nghiệp sử dụng CL, do đó ràng buộc doanh nghiệp đó vào TOU, chúng tôi sẽ cấp cho bạn một giấy phép có giới hạn, có thể thu hồi được, không độc quyền, không thể chuyển nhượng để sử dụng CL phù hợp với TOU; việc sử dụng mà không có giấy phép là một việc không được phép. Bạn đồng ý không hiển thị, \"frame\" (diễn đạt), tạo ra các sản phẩm phái sinh, phân phối, cấp phép hoặc bán, nội dung của CL, ngoại trừ các bài đăng do bạn tạo ra. Bạn cấp cho chúng tôi giấy phép vĩnh viễn, không thể thu hồi, không giới hạn, trên toàn thế giới, được thanh toán đầy đủ / có thể cấp phép lại cho người khác để sử dụng, sao chép, hiển thị, phân phối và tạo các sản phẩm phái sinh từ nội dung bạn đăng. Trừ khi được chúng tôi cấp phép trong hợp đồng bằng văn bản, bạn đồng ý không sử dụng hoặc cung cấp phần mềm (ngoại trừ các trình duyệt web và ứng dụng email chung) hoặc các dịch vụ tương tác hoặc vận hành chung với CL, ví dụ: để tải xuống, tải lên, tạo / truy cập / sử dụng một tài khoản, đăng bài, gắn cờ, gửi email, tìm kiếm hoặc sử dụng điện thoại di động. Bạn đồng ý không sao chép / thu thập nội dung CL thông qua các rô-bốt, nhện (spiders), tập lệnh (scripts), cào (scrapers), trình thu thập thông tin (crawlers), hoặc bất kỳ thứ gì tự động hoặc thủ công tương đương (ví dụ: bằng tay). Nghiêm cấm các bài đăng / giao tiếp / tài khoản gây nhầm lẫn, tự phát (unsolicited), và / hoặc trái pháp luật, cũng như việc mua hoặc bán tài khoản. Bạn đồng ý không đăng nội dung bị cấm bởi bất kỳ chính sách hoặc quy định nào của CL được nêu ở trên (\"Nội dung bị cấm\"). Bạn đồng ý không lạm dụng các quy trình báo cáo hoặc gắn cờ của CL.

Bạn đồng ý rằng nếu bạn vi phạm phần SỬ DỤNG, hoặc bạn khuyến khích, hỗ trợ, hưởng lợi từ việc, hoặc lôi kéo người khác làm như vậy, bạn sẽ phải hoàn toàn liên đới chịu trách nhiệm như nhau trong việc chi trả cho chúng tôi những khoản tiền bồi thường cho những việc như sau: (A) thu thập / lấy thông tin của người dùng CL, bao gồm thông tin cá nhân hoặc thông tin nhận dạng - $1 cho mỗi vi phạm; (B) công bố / lạm dụng thông tin cá nhân hoặc thông tin nhận dạng của một bên thứ ba trong quá trình bạn sử dụng CL mà không có sự đồng ý rõ ràng bằng văn bản của bên đó - $1,000 cho mỗi vi phạm; (C) trình bày sai thông tin nhận dạng hoặc mối liên kết với bất cứ ai của bạn trong quá trình bạn sử dụng CL - $1,000 cho mỗi vi phạm; (D) đăng hoặc cố đăng nội dung bị cấm - $4 cho mỗi vi phạm; (E) đăng hoặc cố đăng nội dung bị cấm vào bất kỳ phần phải trả tiền nào của CL - giá cho mỗi bài đăng tại phần đó theo biểu giá của CL; (F) gửi email không được phép / tự phát tới một địa chỉ email có được từ CL - $25 cho mỗi vi phạm; (G) sử dụng thông tin người dùng CL để tạo / gửi một tin nhắn văn bản, gọi điện đến, hoặc giao tiếp trái phép / tự phát với người dùng CL - $500 cho mỗi tin nhắn văn bản / cuộc gọi / giao tiếp; (H) tạo ra một tài khoản CL gây nhầm lẫn hoặc trái pháp luật hoặc mua / bán tài khoản CL - $4 cho mỗi vi phạm; (I) lạm dụng hoặc cố lạm dụng các quy trình gắn cờ hoặc báo cáo của CL - $1 cho mỗi vi phạm; (J) phân phối bất kỳ phần mềm nào để tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho việc vi phạm các điều khoản trong phần SỬ DỤNG - $1,000 cho mỗi vi phạm; (K) tổng hợp, hiển thị, sao chép, nhân bản, tái sản xuất, phân phối hoặc khai thác nội dung CL cho bất kỳ mục đích nào mà không có sự đồng ý rõ ràng bằng văn bản của chúng tôi - $3,000 cho mỗi ngày bạn có các vi phạm đó; (L) yêu cầu, xem hoặc truy cập hơn 1.000 trang CL trong vòng 24 giờ - $0,25 mỗi trang trong vòng 24 giờ sau 1.000 trang đầu tiên; (M) đi vòng hoặc cố đi vòng để tránh né các nỗ lực điều chỉnh của chúng tôi - $4 cho mỗi vi phạm. Bạn đồng ý rằng những khoản tiền này là (1) sự ước tính hợp lý những thiệt hại của chúng tôi (bởi vì thiệt hại thực tế thường rất khó tính), (2) không phải là tiền phạt, và (3) không vì vậy mà giới hạn khả năng đòi bồi thường của chúng tôi theo bất kỳ nguyên lý hoặc yêu cầu bồi thường hợp pháp nào, bao gồm các khoản tiền bồi thường theo luật định và biện pháp hợp lý khác (ví dụ như đối với hành vi ‘spam’, chúng tôi có thể lựa chọn khoản tiền bồi thường nêu bên trên hoặc khoản tiền bồi thường theo luật định chiếu theo các quy định pháp luật về chống ‘spam’). Ngoài ra, bạn đồng ý rằng những vi phạm lặp đi lặp lại trong phần SỬ DỤNG sẽ gây tổn hại không thể sửa chữa được và cho phép chúng tôi thực hiện các biện pháp cấm đoán hoặc biện pháp hợp lý, bên cạnh việc áp đặt tiền bồi thường. Bạn cho phép chúng tôi tính phí vào tài khoản của bạn về các khoản phí CL thuộc các hạng mục phải trả tiền ( ). Phí chưa bao gồm thuế. Các khoản phí không được hoàn lại, ngay cả đối với các bài đăng mà chúng tôi xoá, trì hoãn, bỏ qua, phân loại lại, xếp hạng lại hoặc điều chỉnh theo các cách khác. Chúng tôi có thể từ chối bất kỳ bài đăng nào. Trong phạm vi được pháp luật cho phép, craigslist, Inc., và các nhân viên, giám đốc, người làm công, đại lý, người cấp phép, chi nhánh, và người kế thừa quyền lợi (\"Các thực thể CL\") (1) không cam kết, đảm bảo hoặc đại diện cho CL, bao gồm sự đầy đủ, chính xác, khả dụng, kịp thời, hợp lý, an toàn hoặc tin cậy của CL; (2) cung cấp CL trên cơ sở \"NHƯ HIỆN TẠI\" (as is) và \"NHƯ SẴN CÓ\" (as available) và bất kỳ rủi ro nào khi sử dụng CL là do bạn chịu; (3) không chịu trách nhiệm về mọi sự đảm bảo, dù được thể hiện rõ ràng hay mang tính hàm ý, bao gồm đảm bảo sự chính xác, khả năng mua bán được, sự phù hợp cho một mục đích nào đó và sự không vi phạm (quyền sở hữu trí tuệ); và (4) không chịu trách nhiệm pháp lý hoặc có trách nhiệm đối với các hành động, sự thiếu sót, hoặc hành vi của bạn hoặc bất kỳ bên nào liên quan đến CL. Các thực thể CL KHÔNG chịu trách nhiệm về bất kỳ thiệt hại trực tiếp, gián tiếp, mang tính hậu quả, ngẫu nhiên, đặc biệt, mang tính trừng phạt hoặc các thiệt hại khác, bao gồm mất lợi nhuận, thu nhập, dữ liệu, thiện chí, v.v. phát sinh từ hoặc liên quan đến CL, và trong bất kỳ tình huống nào thì trách nhiệm pháp lý cũng không vượt quá $100 hoặc số tiền bạn đã trả cho chúng tôi trong năm trước khi xảy ra thiệt hại. Pháp luật một số nước hạn chế hoặc thay đổi các tuyên bố miễn trừ và giới hạn này, do đó một số quy định có thể không áp dụng cho bạn. Bất kỳ khiếu nại, quyền khiếu nại, yêu cầu, hoặc tranh chấp phát sinh từ hoặc liên quan đến CL (\"Khiếu nại\") sẽ được điều chỉnh bởi luật nội bộ của tiểu bang California, không xét đến việc các quy định pháp luật có xung đột, ngoại trừ phạm vi mà luật pháp liên bang của Hoa Kỳ điều chỉnh. Các khiếu nại sẽ được giải quyết duy nhất bởi các tòa án ở San Francisco, CA (trừ trường hợp chúng tôi tìm kiếm các biện pháp bước đầu hoặc biện pháp ngăn chặn ở nơi khác). Bạn đồng ý (1) nộp (các khiếu nại) cho bộ phận thẩm quyền cá nhân của các tòa án tại San Francisco, CA; (2) bồi thường và giữ cho các thực thể CL không chịu trách nhiệm đối với bất kỳ các khiếu nại, tổn thất, trách nhiệm pháp lý, hoặc chi phí nào (bao gồm cả phí luật sư) phát sinh từ bên thứ ba và liên quan đến việc bạn sử dụng CL; và (3) chịu trách nhiệm pháp lý và có trách nhiệm đối với bất kỳ khiếu nại nào mà chúng tôi có thể có chống lại các nhân viên, giám đốc, người làm công, đại lý, chi nhánh, hoặc bất kỳ bên nào khác, trực tiếp hoặc gián tiếp, do bạn điều khiển hoặc kiểm soát, hoặc hành động vì lợi ích của bạn. CRAIGSLIST, \"CL\" và logo biểu tượng hòa bình là nhãn hiệu thương mại đã được đăng ký với Văn phòng Bằng sáng chế và Nhãn hiệu thương mại Hoa Kỳ và với nhiều văn phòng quản lý thương hiệu trên toàn thế giới. Những người dùng tuân thủ theo các giấy phép bằng văn bản trước đây có thể truy cập CL theo các giấy phép đó cho đến khi sự cho phép bị chấm dứt. Nếu không, đây là thỏa thuận duy nhất và toàn bộ giữa chúng tôi và bạn, và hành động hoặc sự im lặng của chúng tôi đối với bạn hoặc bất kỳ ai khác không từ bỏ, sửa đổi hoặc giới hạn TOU hoặc khả năng để thi hành nó của chúng tôi. Các phần SỬ DỤNG, TIỀN BỒI THƯỜNG PHẢI TRẢ, và KHIẾU NẠI & BỒI THƯỜNG sẽ tiếp tục tồn tại sau khi hủy bỏ TOU, và bạn vẫn sẽ bị ràng buộc bởi những phần đó. Nếu một điều khoản trong TOU là không thể thi hành được, nó sẽ được giới hạn trong phạm vi tối thiểu có thể và được bổ sung thêm một điều khoản hợp lệ thể hiện tốt nhất ý định của các bên. Phiên bản tiếng Anh của TOU có giá trị cao hơn bất kỳ bản dịch nào. Nếu bạn tin rằng các nội dung vi phạm quyền sở hữu trí tuệ của bạn, hãy xem . Có câu hỏi? Gửi email đến ."},

Ved å gå inn på eller på andre måter samhandle med våre servere, tjenester eller nettsteder, eller annet tilknyttet innhold/innlegg (samlet \"CL\") samtykker du i disse brukervilkårene (sist oppdatert 29. desember 2017). Du samtykker i og anerkjenner at CL er et privat nettsted som eies og drives av craigslist, Inc. Hvis du går inn på eller bruker CL på vegne av en forretningsvirksomhet, samtykker virksomheten i disse brukervilkårene. Hvis du ikke samtykker i vilkårene, har du ikke tillatelse til å bruke CL. Vi kan når som helst endre brukervilkårene, etter eget forgodtbefinnende. Du er ansvarlig for å periodevis se etter endringer, og du er bundet av disse hvis du fortsetter å bruke CL. Vår personvernpolitikk ( ), forbudsliste ( ) og alle andre retningslinjer, nettstedsregler og avtaler som omtales nedenfor eller på CL, utgjør fullt og helt en del av disse brukervilkårene, og du samtykker også i disse. Hvis du samtykker i brukervilkårene og (1) er gammel og myndig nok til å bruke CL og til å bindes av brukervilkårene eller (2) bruker CL på vegne av en virksomhet, og dermed binder virksomheten til brukervilkårene, gir vi deg en begrenset, gjenkallelig, ikke-eksklusiv og ikke videreførbar lisens til å bruke CL i samsvar med brukervilkårene. Ikke-lisensiert bruk er ikke tillatt. Du samtykker i å ikke vise, \"ramme inn\", utvikle utledede verker av, distribuere, lisensiere eller selge innhold fra CL, herunder innlegg du selv har laget. Du gir oss en evigvarende, ugjenkallelig, ubegrenset, verdensomspennende, fullt betalt / underlisensierbar lisens til å bruke, kopiere, vise, distribuere og opprette utledede verker av innholdet du legger ut. Med mindre lisens er gitt av oss etter skriftlig avtale, samtykker du i å ikke bruke eller tilveiebringe programvare (med unntak av nettlesere og e-postklienter til generell bruk) eller tjenester som samhandler eller samspiller med CL, for eksempel for nedlasting, opplasting, oppretting / adgang til / bruk av en konto, innlegg, flagging, e-poster, søk eller mobil bruk. Du samtykker i å ikke kopiere/innhente CL-innhold via roboter, indekseringsroboter, søkeroboter eller andre automatiserte eller manuelle tilsvarende måter (f.eks. for hånd). Villedende, uoppfordrede og/eller ulovlige innhold/kommunikasjon/konti er forbudt, og det samme er å kjøpe eller selge konti. Du samtykker i å ikke legge ut innhold som er forbudt etter CLs retningslinjer og regler som angitt ovenfor (\"forbudt innhold\"). Du samtykker i å ikke misbruke CLs prosesser for melding eller rapportering. Du samtykker i å ikke innhente brukerinformasjon fra CL eller forstyrre CL. Du samtykker i at vi kan moderere adgang til / bruk av CL etter vårt eget forgodtbefinnende, f.eks. ved å blokkere, filtrere, omkategorisere, omrangere, slette, utsette, holde, utelate, verifisere eller avbryte din adgang/lisens/konto. Du samtykker i (1) å ikke omgå nevnte moderering, (2) at vi ikke er ansvarlige for å moderere eller unnlate å moderere og (3) at ingenting vi sier skal fjerne vår rett til å moderere eller ikke. Du samtykker videre i at hvis du misbruker avsnittet BRUK, eller hvis du oppfordrer til, støtter, nyter godt av eller foranlediger andre til å gjøre det, vil du være, samlet eller individuelt, ansvarlig overfor oss for likviderte erstatninger som følger for: (A) innhenting av CL-brukeres informasjon, inkludert personlig eller identifiserbar informasjon – 1 dollar per overtredelse; (B) offentliggjøring/misbruk av personlig eller identifiserbar informasjon for en tredjepart i forbindelse med din bruk av CL uten partens uttrykkelige og skriftlige samtykker – 1000 dollar per overtredelse; (C) feilrepresentering av din identitet eller tilknytning til andre i forbindelse med din bruk av CL – 1000 per brudd; (D) utlegging av eller forsøk på utlegging av forbudt innhold – 4 dollar per overtredelse; (E) utlegging av eller forsøk å utlegging av forbudt innhold i en betalt del av CL – prisen per innlegg som gjelder for den delen av CL; (F) sending av en uautorisert/uoppfordret e-post til en e-postadresse innhentet fra CL – 25 dollar per brudd; (G) bruk av CL-brukerinformasjon til å foreta/sende en uautorisert/uoppfordret tekstmelding, oppringing eller kommunikasjon til en CL-bruker – 500 dollar per tekst/samtale/kommunikasjon; (H) oppretting av en villedende eller ulovlig CL-konto eller kjøp/salg av en CL-konto – 4 dollar per overtredelse; (I) misbruk eller forsøk på misbruk av CLs prosesser for melding og rapportering – 1 dollar per overtredelse; (J) distribuering av programvare som tilrettelegger for brudd på BRUK-avsnittet - 1000 dollar per overtredelse; (K) aggregering, visning, kopiering, duplisering, gjengivelse, distribuering eller utnytting av CL-innhold for andre formål uten vårt uttrykkelige og skriftlige samtykke; (L) forespørring, visning eller adgang til over 1000 sider i CL i løpet av en 24-timersperiode – 0,25 dollar per side i løpet av 24-timersperioden etter de første 1000 sidene; (M) omgåing eller forsøk på omgåing av våre modereringstiltak – 4 dollar per overtredelse. Du samtykker i at disse beløpene er (1) en rimelig beregning av vår skade (fordi faktisk skade ofte er vanskelig å beregne), (2) ikke en straff og (3) ikke på annet vis en begrensning av vår anledning til å innhente, under enhver juridisk teori eller ethvert juridisk krav, herunder lovlig erstatning og annen rettferdig erstatning eller lovmessig erstatning iht. antispam-lovene). Du samtykker videre i at gjentatte brudd på avsnittet BRUK vil medføre uopprettelig skade og gi oss rett til rettspåbud eller rettferdig oppreisning, i tillegg til monetær erstatning. Du gir oss tillatelse til å belaste din konto for CL-relaterte gebyrer i betalingsområdene ( ). Eventuell skatt kommer i tillegg. Gebyrene kan ikke refunderes, selv ikke for innlegg som vi sletter, forsinker, utelater, omkategoriserer, omrangerer eller på andre måter modererer. Vi har rett til å avvise ethvert innlegg. I den grad loven tillater det vil craigslist, Inc. og deres representanter, direktører, ansatte, ledelse, lisenshavere, tilknyttede selskaper og etterfølgere med interesse (\"CL-enheter\") ikke gi noen løfter eller garantier når det gjelder CL, inkludert deres fullstendighet, nøyaktighet, tilgjengelighet, betimelighet, hensiktsmessighet, sikkerhet eller pålitelighet; (2) tilveiebringe CL på en \"SOM DET ER\"- og \"SOM TILGJENGELIG\"-basis, og enhver risiko forbundet med bruk påtas av deg; (3) frasi ethvert krav på garantier, uttrykkelige eller impliserte, inkludert mht. nøyaktighet, salgbarhet, egnethet for et bestemt formål og ikke-brudd; og (4) frasi ethvert ansvar for handlinger, utelatelser eller oppførsel fra deg eller en annen part i forbindelse med CL. CL-enhetene er IKKE ansvarlig for eventuelle direkte, indirekte, følgemessige, utilsiktede, spesielle, strafferettslige eller andre tap, herunder tap av profitt, inntekt, data, goodwill osv., som oppstår som følge av eller i tilknytning til CL, og ikke under noen omstendigheter skal et slikt beløp overstige 100 dollar eller beløpet du betalte oss i året før tapet ble inntruffet. Enkelte jurisdiksjoner kan begrense eller endre denne ansvarsfraskrivelsen og begrensningene, og enkelte av disse kan derfor kanskje ikke gjelde for deg. Eventuelle krav, saksgrunnlag eller tvister som oppstår som følge av eller i tilknytning til CL (\"krav) skal styres av de interne lovene i delstaten California, uten hensyn til lovkonflikt, unntatt i den grad det styres av amerikansk føderal lov. Eventuelle krav skal behandles utelukkende av domstolene i San Francisco i California (unntatt i tilfeller der vi søker innledende erstatning eller rettspåbud andre steder). Du samtykker i å (1) være underlagt personlig jurisdiksjon i domstolene i San Francisco i California; (2) holde CL skadesløs fra eventuelle krav, tap, ansvar eller utgifter (herunder inkludert advokatutgifter) som oppstår fra en tredjepart i tilknytning til din bruk av CL; og (3) være ansvarlig for eventuelle krav vi kan ha mot dine direktører, ansatte, representanter, tilknyttede selskaper eller andre parter, direkte eller indirekte, betalt, anmodet eller kontrollert av deg eller som handler til din fordel. CRAIGSLIST, \"CL\" og fredssymbolet er registrerte varemerker i det amerikanske patentkontoret og flere varemerkekontorer verden over. Brukere som overholder tidligere skriftlige lisenser kan få tilgang til CL med disse frem til autorisasjon avsluttes. Ellers er denne eksklusive avtalen mellom oss og deg, og våre handlinger og stillhet overfor deg og andre skal på ingen måte frasi, modifisere eller begrense brukervilkårene eller vår anledning til å håndheve dem. Avsnittene BRUK, LIKVIDERTE SKADER og KRAV OG ANSVAR skal overleve avslutning av brukervilkårene, og du vil forbli bundet av disse avsnittene. Hvis et brukervilkår ikke kan håndheves, skal det begrenses i den grad det er mulig og vedlegg med en gyldig bestemmelse som i størst grad mulig dekker begge parters hensikt. Den engelske utgaven av brukervilkårene skal gå foran oversettelser. Hvis du har rimelig grunn til å anta at innholdet bryter dine IP-rettigheter, henvises du til . Spørsmål? Send en e-post til ."},

Ayrıca, KULLANIM bölümünü ihlal ederseniz veya böyle yapması için başkalarını teşvik eder, destekler, fayda sağlar ya da ikna ederseniz, aşağıdaki maddi zararlardan müştereken ve müteselsilen sorumlu olacağınızı kabul ediyorsunuz: (A) kişisel veya tanımlayıcı bilgiler de dahil olmak üzere CL kullanıcılarının bilgilerini toplama - ihlal başına 1$; (B) CL'yi kullanmanızla bağlantılı olarak, söz konusu tarafın açık yazılı izni olmaksızın, üçüncü bir tarafın kişisel veya tanımlayıcı bilgilerini yayınlama/kötüye kullanma; ihlal başına 1,000 $; (C) CL'yi kullanmanızla bağlantılı olarak kimliğinizi ya da herhangi biriyle bağlantınızı yanlış beyan etme - ihlal başına 1,000 $; (D) Yasaklanmış İçeriği yayınlama veya yayınlamaya çalışma - ihlal başına 4 $; (E) Yasaklanmış İçeriği CL'nin ücretli bölümünde yayınlama veya yayınlamaya çalışma - CL'nin bu bölümünde geçerli olan ilan fiyat; (F) CL'den elde edilen bir e-posta adresine izinsiz/teklifsiz e-posta gönderme - ihlal başına 25 $; (G) bir CL kullanıcısına yetkisiz/teklifsiz kısa mesaj, çağrı göndermek, arama yapmak veya iletişime geçmek için CL kullanıcı bilgilerini kullanma - metin/arama/iletişim başına 500 dolar; (H) yanıltıcı veya kanuna aykırı bir CL hesabı oluşturma veya bir CL hesabı satın alma/satma - ihlal başına 4 $; (I) CL'nin işaretleme veya raporlama süreçlerini kötüye kullanma veya kötüye kullanma girişiminde bulunma - ihlal başına 1 $; (J) KULLANIM Bölümünün ihlal edilmesini kolaylaştırmak için herhangi bir yazılımı dağıtma - İhlal başına 1,000 $; (K) CL içeriğini, açık ve yazılı iznimiz olmaksızın, herhangi bir amaçla toplama, görüntüleme, kopyalama, suretini çıkarma, çoğaltma, dağıtma veya istismar etme - bu tür ihlalleri gerçekleştirdiğiniz her gün için 3,000 $; (L) herhangi bir 24 saatlik periyotta 1,000 sayfadan fazla CL talep etme, inceleme veya erişme - ilk 1,000 sayfadan sonraki 24 saatlik süre boyunca sayfa başına 0.25 dolar; (M) denetim çabalarımızı atlatma veya atlatmaya çalışma - ihlal başına $ 4. Bu tutarların, (1) (fiili hasarların hesaplanması genellikle zor olduğundan), tazminatların makul bir tahmini olduğunu, (2) bir ceza olmadığını ve (3) kanuni tazminat ve diğer parasal olmayan tedbir (örneğin, istenmeyen e-postalar için, istenmeyen e-postaları engelleme mevzuatı uyarınca yukarıda belirtilen maddi tazminat veya kanuni tazminat arasında seçim yapabiliriz) de dahil olmak üzere, herhangi bir hukuki dayanak veya hak talebine göre telafi kabiliyetimizi sınırlamadığını kabul ediyorsunuz. Ayrıca, KULLANIM bölümünün tekrar tekrar ihlal edilmesinin onarılmaz şekilde zarar oluşturacağını ve bize maddi tazminatın yanı sıra ihtiyati veya adil telafi hakkı vereceğini kabul ediyorsunuz. Ücretli alanlarda ( ) CL ücretleri için hesabınızı ücretlendirmemize yetki veriyorsunuz. Her türlü vergi ücretlere ilave edilir. Ücretler, kaldırılan, geciktirilen, hariç tutulan, yeniden sınıflandırılan, yeniden sıralanan veya başka şekilde denetlenen ilanlar için bile geri ödenmez. Herhangi bir ilanı reddedebiliriz. Yasaların izin verdiği ölçüde, craigslist, Inc., ve görevlileri, yöneticileri, çalışanları, vekilleri, lisans verenleri, bağlı kuruluşları ve mirasçıları (\"CL Kuruluşları\") (1) eksiksizlik, doğruluk, kullanılabilirlik, zamanında olma, uygunluk, güvenlik veya güvenilirlik de dahil olmak üzere, CL ile ilgili olarak, herhangi bir söz, taahhüt veremez veya beyanda bulunamaz; (2) CL'yi \"OLDUĞU GİBİ\" ve \"MEVCUT HALİYLE\" sunar ve CL'yi kullanma riski tarafınızdan üstlenilir; (3) doğruluk, ticarete elverişlilik, belirli bir amaca uygunluk ve ihlal edilmeme de dahil olmak üzere açık veya zımni her türlü teminatı reddeder ve (4) sizin veya herhangi bir tarafın CL ile bağlantılı olarak herhangi bir fiil, ihmal veya davranışı veya sorumluluğunu reddeder. CL Kuruluşları, CL'den kaynaklanan veya CL ile ilgili olan kar, gelir, veri, itibar vb. de dahil olmak üzere doğrudan, dolaylı, sonuç olarak ortaya çıkan, arızi, özel, cezai veya diğer kayıplardan sorumlu değildir ve hiçbir durumda bu tür sorumluluk 100 doları veya söz konusu kayıptan önceki bir yılda bize ödemiş olduğunuz tutarı aşamaz. Bazı yargı bölgeleri, bu sorumluluk reddi ve sınırlara sınırlama getirmekte veya değiştirmektedir; bu nedenle bazıları sizin için geçerli olmayabilir. CL'den kaynaklanan veya bununla bağlantılı olan herhangi bir hak talebi, dava sebebi, iddia veya uyuşmazlık (\"İddialar\"), ABD federal yasalarına tabi haller dışında, kanunlar ihtilafı hükümlerine bakılmaksızın Kaliforniya iç hukukuna tabidir. Her türlü İddia, sadece San Francisco, CA'daki mahkemelerde görülür (ancak herhangi bir yerde ön veya tedbir kararı isteyebiliriz). (1) San Francisco, CA mahkemelerinin kişisel yetkisine tabi olmayı; (2) CL Kuruluşlarını, bir üçüncü taraftan kaynaklanan ve CL'yi kullanımınızla ilgili olan herhangi bir Hak Talebi, kayıp, yükümlülük veya (avukatlık ücretleri de dahil) masraftan beri tutmayı ve tazmin etmeyi ve (3) doğrudan veya dolaylı olarak, tarafınızdan ödenen, yönlendirilen veya kontrol edilen veya menfaatiniz için hareket edecek olan memurlarınız, direktörleriniz, çalışanlarınız, temsilcileriniz, bağlı kuruluşlarınız veya başka herhangi bir tarafa karşı herhangi bir hak talebimizden sorumlu olacağınızı kabul ediyorsunuz. CRAIGSLIST, \"CL\" ve barış sembolü logosu ABD Patent ve Marka Ofisi ve dünya genelinde çok sayıda marka ofisinde tescilli ticari markalardır. Daha önceki yazılı lisanslara bağlı kalan kullanıcılar, bu yetki sona erdirilinceye kadar CL’ye erişebilir. Aksi takdirde bu, sizinle bizim aramızdaki tek sözleşmedir ve size veya başka herhangi birisine karşı fiil veya sükutumuz, KK veya bu yetkileri uygulama yetkimizden feragat etme, değiştirme veya sınırlandırma anlamına gelmez. KULLANIM, MADDİ ZARAR, HAK TALEPLERİ VE TAZMİNAT bölümleri KK'nİn feshinden sonra da geçerlidir ve bu bölümler sizin için bağlayıcı olmaya devam eder. Bir KK şartının geçerliliğini kaybetmesi halinde, mümkün olan en az kapsamla sınırlandırılır ve tarafların amacını en iyi şekilde yerine getiren geçerli bir hükümle tamamlanır. KK'nin İngilizce versiyonu her türlü çeviri versiyonunun üzerindedir. İçeriğin IP haklarınızı ihlal ettiğine inanmanız için makul sebep olması halinde, bkz. Cl.com/about/dmca.

En accédant à nos serveurs, services, sites Web, ou tout(e) contenu/annonce associé(e) (désignés collectivement par l’abréviation « CL ») ou en interagissant avec ceux-ci, vous acceptez les présentes Conditions générales d’utilisation (« CGU ») (mises à jour pour la dernière fois le 29 décembre 2017). Vous reconnaissez et acceptez que CL est un site privé possédé et exploité par craigslist, Inc. Si vous accédez ou utilisez CL pour le compte d’une entreprise, cette entreprise accepte ces CGU. Si vous n’acceptez pas les présentes CGU, vous n’êtes pas autorisé à utiliser CL. Nous nous réservons le droit de modifier à tout moment ces CGU à notre seule discrétion. Il relève de votre responsabilité de vérifier périodiquement si des modifications ont été apportées, et celles-ci seront exécutoires si vous continuez à utiliser CL. Notre politique de confidentialité ( ), liste des interdictions ( ) et toutes les autres politiques, règles du site, et contrats référencés ci-dessous ou sur CL sont entièrement intégrés à ces CGU, et vous les acceptez également. Si vous acceptez les CGU et (1) que vous êtes suffisamment âgé et avez les capacités suffisantes pour utiliser CL et être lié par ces CGU, ou (2) utilisez CL pour le compte d’une entreprise, liant ainsi cette entreprise aux CGU, nous vous accordons une licence limitée, révocable, non exclusive, non transférable d’utilisation de CL conformément aux CGU ; une utilisation sans licence est interdite. Vous acceptez de ne pas afficher, « encadrer », créer des œuvres dérivées, distribuer, accorder une licence ou vendre des contenus de CL, à l’exclusion des annonces que vous créez. Vous nous accordez une licence perpétuelle, irrévocable, illimitée, dans le monde entier, entièrement payée/cessible pour utiliser, copier, afficher, distribuer et générer des œuvres dérivées des contenus que vous publiez. Sauf si nous vous y autorisons par un contrat écrit, vous vous engagez à ne pas utiliser ou fournir des logiciels (à l’exclusion de clients de messagerie et de navigateurs web à usage général) ou des services qui interagissent avec CL, par ex. pour le téléchargement, la création/l’accès/l’utilisation d’un compte, la publication, le signalement, l’envoi par e-mail, la recherche, ou l’utilisation mobile. Vous acceptez de ne pas copier/collecter des contenus CL via des robots, des araignées, des scripts, des « scrapers », des « crawlers », ou n’importe quel équivalent automatisé ou manuel (p. ex., à la main). Les annonces/communications/comptes trompeurs, non sollicités et/ou illicites sont interdits, comme le sont l’achat et la vente de comptes. Vous acceptez de ne pas publier de contenus interdits par l’une des politiques ou des règles de CL référencées ci-dessus (les « Contenus interdits »). Vous acceptez de ne pas porter atteinte aux processus de signalement ou de rapports de CL. Vous acceptez de ne pas recueillir des informations d’utilisateurs de CL et de ne pas interférer avec CL.

Vous acceptez (1) de ne pas contourner ladite modération (2) que nous ne soyons pas responsables d’une modération ou non-modération et (3) que rien de ce que nous puissions dire ou faire n’annule notre droit à modérer ou non. De plus, vous convenez que si vous violez la section UTILISATION ou que vous encouragez ou incitez d’autres à le faire, les soutenez, ou bénéficiez d’une telle violation, vous serez conjointement et solidairement responsable envers nous pour le versement de dommages-intérêts préétablis comme suit : (A) collecter des informations des utilisateurs de CL, y compris de renseignements personnels ou nominatifs - 1 $ par violation ; (B) publier/utiliser à mauvais escient des renseignements personnels ou nominatifs d’une tierce partie dans le cadre de votre utilisation de CL sans le consentement exprès écrit de cette tierce partie - 1 000 $ par violation ; (C) présenter faussement votre identité ou votre affiliation à quiconque ou une quelconque entité dans le cadre de votre utilisation de CL - 1 000 $ par violation ; (D) publier ou tenter de publier des Contenus interdits - 4 $ par violation ; (E) publier ou tenter de publier des Contenus interdits dans toute section payante de CL - le prix par publication applicable à cette section de CL ; (F) envoyer un e-mail non autorisé/non sollicité vers une adresse e-mail obtenue de CL - 25 $ par violation ; (G) utiliser des renseignements sur les utilisateurs de CL pour envoyer/passer un message texte, un appel ou une communication non autorisé(e)/non sollicité(e) à un utilisateur de CL - 500 $ par texte/appel/communication ; (H) créer un compte CL trompeur ou illégal ou acheter/vendre un CL compte - 4 $ par violation ; (I) porter atteinte ou tenter de porter atteinte aux processus de signalement ou de rapports de CL - 1 $ par violation ; (J) distribuer un logiciel pour faciliter des violations de la section UTILISATION - 1 000 $ par violation ; (K) agréger, afficher, copier, dupliquer, reproduire, distribuer ou exploiter des contenus de CL à toute fin sans notre consentement exprès écrit - 3 000 $ pour chaque jour où vous perpétrez de telles violations ; (L) demander, afficher ou accéder à plus de 1000 pages de CL dans toute période de 24 heures - 0,25 $ par page au cours de la période de 24 heures après les 1000 premières pages ; (M) contourner ou tenter de contourner nos efforts de modération - 4 $ par violation. Vous acceptez que ces montants sont (1) une estimation raisonnable de nos dommages (les dommages réels étant souvent difficiles à calculer), (2) ne constituent pas une pénalité, et (3) ne limitent pas par ailleurs notre capacité de recouvrement en vertu de toute théorie juridique ou de réclamation, y compris des dommages-intérêts légaux et autre compensation équitable (p. ex., pour du spam, nous pouvons choisir entre les dommages-intérêts préétablis ci-dessus et des dommages-intérêts légaux en vertu de la législation antispam). Vous acceptez en outre que des violations répétées de la section UTILISATION nous causeraient des dommages irréparables et nous autoriseraient à engager une action en justice afin d’obtenir une mesure injonctive ou toute autre mesure équitable, en plus de dommages-intérêts. Vous nous autorisez à débiter votre compte pour les frais encourus dans les régions payantes ( fees). Les taxes sont en sus. Les frais ne sont pas remboursables, même pour des annonces que nous retirons, retardons, omettons, recatégorisons, reclassifions ou modérons d’une autre manière. Nous pouvons refuser de publier toute annonce. Dans la pleine mesure permise par la loi, craigslist, Inc. et ses dirigeants, administrateurs, employés, agents, concédants de licence, sociétés affiliées et ayant droit (les « Entités CL ») (1) ne font aucune promesse ou déclaration et ne donnent aucune garantie concernant CL, notamment concernant son exhaustivité, son exactitude, sa disponibilité, ses délais, sa convenance, sa sécurité ou sa fiabilité ; (2) fournissent CL « EN L’ÉTAT » et « TEL QUE DISPONIBLE », et vous assumez tout risque d’utilisation de CL ; (3) dénient toute garantie explicite ou implicite, notamment d’exactitude, de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier ou de non-contrefaçon ; et (4) déclinent toute responsabilité pour des actes, omissions ou conduites de vous ou de toute partie en relation avec CL. Les entités CL ne peuvent PAS être tenues pour responsables de pertes directes, indirectes, consécutives, fortuites, spéciales, punitives ou autres, notamment des pertes de bénéfices, de revenus, de données, de réputation, etc., résultant de ou liées à CL, et en aucun cas une telle responsabilité ne pourra dépasser 100 $ ou le montant que vous nous avez versé au cours de l’année précédant une telle perte. Certaines juridictions restreignent ou modifient ces exclusions et limites, de sorte que certaines d’entre elles pourraient ne pas vous concerner. Les réclamations, causes d’action, demandes, ou différends découlant de CL ou liés à ce dernier (les « Réclamations ») seront régis par les lois internes de l’État de Californie, sans égard aux dispositions relatives aux conflits de lois, sauf dans la mesure régie par la loi fédérale des États-Unis. Les Réclamations seront exclusivement résolues par les tribunaux de San Francisco, Californie (sauf dans les cas où nous demanderions une mesure injonctive ou préliminaire ailleurs). Vous vous engagez à (1) vous soumettre à la compétence personnelle des tribunaux de San Francisco, Californie ; (2) indemniser et dégager de toute responsabilité les Entités CL pour toutes Réclamations, pertes, charges ou dépenses (y compris les honoraires d’avocats) émanant d’une tierce partie et relatives à votre utilisation de CL ; et (3) être tenu responsable des Réclamations que nous pourrions présenter contre vos dirigeants, directeurs, employés, agents, sociétés affiliées ou toute autre partie, directement ou indirectement, payés, dirigés ou contrôlés par vous, ou agissant pour votre compte.

Les utilisateurs qui se conforment à des licences écrites antérieures peuvent les utiliser pour accéder à CL jusqu’à la fin de l’autorisation. Sinon, les présentes constituent l’accord exclusif et complet entre vous et nous, et nos actions ou notre silence envers vous ou une autre personne ne constituent pas une renonciation, une modification ou une limitation des présentes CGU ou de notre capacité à les appliquer. Les sections UTILISATION, DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS PRÉÉTABLIS, et RÉCLAMATIONS ET INDEMNISATION survivent à la résiliation de ces CGU, et vous resterez lié par ces sections. Si une condition de ces CGU est inopposable, elle devra être limitée aussi peu que possible et être complétée par une disposition valable qui reflète le mieux l’intention des parties.

I am able to supply documentation to support the age of this Johnson, though there is no visible JIN (Johnson Identification Number) on the organ itself; so, unfortunately, a CockFax report will not be available to prospective drivers. This Johnson has been maintained by a single owner, who has also been its primary driver.  There have been three other drivers of this Johnson at various times, all of them within the past five years, and all of them female.  (The most recent of these merely took it for a test drive, and although pleased with its performance, she elected not to continue with its use secondary to geographic concerns.)  Each of these drivers has also been a passenger at some point, and they all expressed satisfaction in the ride of this Johnson.  (Say what you like about women drivers, some of them are actually quite skilled in maneuvering an authentic Johnson, given that chance.)  The original ragtop was displaced shortly after production; however, this Johnson can be (and has been) successfully fitted with a number of synthetic covers for protection from the elements as well as ride comfort and a variety of vaginodynamic effects.  There are no other cosmetic defects; it is otherwise unmodified and has the typical dimensional variability one would expect from an Average Johnson.  It retains its original color:  Classic Caucasian Clearcoat.  All things considered, this Johnson is actually in near-mint condition. I am currently seeking to place this Johnson with another driver/passenger, preferably another female.  Prior familiarity with this type of equipment is desired but not necessary, as I will be present for any test drives/rides and will be able to provide training and/or feedback, as necessary. I am able to supply photos of the owner with or without the Johnson for evaluation purposes, as I assume any prospective new driver(s)/rider(s) might wish to know more about the man who has taken care of this classic piece of equipment and how it has been maintained.  Photos of the Average Johnson itself may be made available at the owner’s discretion. Prospective pilots or passengers should submit a description of any prior Johnson experience as well as their attributes which they feel would make them suitable operators of this vehicle.  They may also wish to submit samples of qualities they seek in a Johnson owner, because—as previously stated—I will be present for any inspections/tests of this conveyance.  (As far as I am aware, no specific license is required to operate this Johnson, though applicants should preferably be of legal age for alcohol consumption; in fact, moderate consumption of adult beverages may have a positive effect on overall performance.)  Responses with photos may receive priority.  Concerns, general questions, and other inquiries are welcome. This is in or around Minneapolis. It’s ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests, so post id: 45837778   "},
